# ObfE - One build from Eden
Bundle of python skripts that help setup and manage mods for **One step from Eden**

You can simply download scripts.zip if you want to use it

_Requires python to be installed on your system to work_

## What does it do?
Have you been modding **One Step from Eden**? Do you have a Spells.xml with hundreds of lines?
It sure would be easier to have several smaller files like MySpell.xml to keep it straight in your head
and make managing your multiple cool spells easier.

Thats where these scripts come in:
### 1. Set up the location for your new mod with setupEden.py
This will create some default folders with `Destination.txt` in dem and bring all the 
scripts you need to manage your mod. Delete any of the folders you dont need and begin!
It will also ask for the location of your steam installation and what your mod should be called.

### 2. Put as many XML-files with any name you want into any directory with a Destination.txt
All files with the same extension in a folder with a `Destination.txt` get combined into the file specified in `Destination.txt`.
So if `Spells.xml` is in your `Destination.txt` then all .xml files in this folder will be put into `Spells.xml`.
If there are subfolders then any .xml files also get combined into `Spells.xml` if you dont include a new `Destination.xml` for them

If you want to also put some .lua files in the same folder just add `Spells.lua` to the `Destination.txt` and then all the lua files will be combined into `Spells.lua`.

This means that you cant put two .xml or .lua destinations into a `Destination.txt`. All files with multiple destinations get ignored!


**Note:** your XML should not contain the outer tags of the respective file. So for your spell XMLs should not 
contain the `<Spells>` tag, just `<Spell>` tags and the stuff between that. The scripts put all your XMLs between these 
tags in the combine step, so no need to do it yourself.

### 3. When you are ready to test your mod, execute buildEdenToLocal.py
This will ask you for your steam location and the name of your mod if you havent specified it yet and then put all
your mod files into your local mods folder for you. If you changed something, simply save your files and run the script 
again!

### 4. Install the mod ingame and test it out!
All your files are where Steam needs them, now you can test your mod and see how it plays!

### 5. When you want to update your mod on the Steam workshop just execute buildEdenToWorkshop.py
If you set up a `WorkshopItemInfo.xml` destination then **ObfE** will look for the `<PublishedFileId>` tag and put 
all your files into the workshop folder with the corresponding ID. No need to look for the folder yourself! Just make
sure that all the information Steam needs for their workshop mods are present. 

Like with all other .xml files you dont need
to include the outer `<WorkshopItemInfo>` tag in your files, **ObfE** will do that for you.

## A note on custom animations and image files
If you have taken a look at the example mod for the character Lea you may have noticed that the .png and .aseprite
files for the movement animations is in a subfolder `char` and get referenced in `Lea_AnimInfo.xml` like this:

```
<Frame image="char/Lea_cast01Start1.png"></Frame>
<Frame image="char/Lea_cast01Start2.png"></Frame>
```
With **ObfE** you dont need to do that. Instead just reference the name of the correct file like this:
```
<Frame image="Lea_cast01Start1.png"></Frame>
<Frame image="Lea_cast01Start2.png"></Frame>
```
This works no matter where in your folder structure the .png files are, because they later all get put into a single folder together with 
all your .xml, .lua and .aseprite files and dont have any hierarchy to them


## How does it work?
The scripts look in the current directory for any subdirectories with Destination.txt.
Then it combines all files in directories with the same destination, and any subfolders 
that dont contain Destination.txt into a single file and finally sends
 it over to your **One step from Eden** Mods folder.

This lets you organize your mod in as many directories and files as you want, given that the 
directories reside in the your base directory with the ObfE scripts and that each directory with mod files in them 
to combine contains a Destination.txt

Destination names are fixed for XML files, so use them as Destination if you set up your own structure.
Lua files can be named however you want, so go nuts!

**Only put one type of Destination for each file type, as otherwise the folder will be ignored for those files.**

### Valid XML destinations
- Artifacts.xml
- Battles.xml
- Effects.lua
- Enemies.xml
- Heroes.xml
- HeroesExtra.xml
- Pacts.xml
- Spells.xml
- Structures.xml
- Tilefields.xml

- XXXAnimInfo.xml       <- you can put anything in place of the "XXX"
